                <h2>Garage System</h2>
                <p>This is a GUI website created for a Garage System, that is to be used with a database in the backend.
                Four of us worked on this project together but each person had different roles in what they needed to code,
                which is laid out in the Project Manual.</p>

                <h2>US Housing: Sale vs Assessed Value - Linear Regression Model</h2>
                <p>This project was created as part of my data science and machine learning module. 
                The model predicts the future sale value and assessed values of single family residential housing in the US.</p>
