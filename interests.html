                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>One of my main passions is video games. My first console (or handheld to be technical) was a Nintendo DS. 
                    Since then I've owned a variety of different consoles and have also built my own PC for gaming. I enjoy challenging and puzzling games which make me think outside the box.</p>
                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>Another one of my main interests is programming, which is one of the reasons I decided to study software development in university.
                    I've experience with a range of different languages but my main ones are Python, Java and Go. Links to my projects, both personal and university related, can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/adam-fitz395" target="_blank" style="color: #6e5494;">GitHub</a>.</p>
                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>I enjoy playing and listening music as a way to unwind. My preferred genres are rock and metal, but I like to listen to all types. I can play guitar.</p>
